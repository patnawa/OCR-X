/**
 * Runtime tuning for the ONNX Runtime sessions.
 *
 * @param numThreads   intra-op thread count for CPU execution.
 * @param useXnnpack   register the XNNPACK execution provider when the runtime
 *                     exposes it. XNNPACK is a CPU backend, so it cannot change
 *                     numerics the way an NPU can; it is safe to leave enabled and
 *                     is silently skipped on builds that do not ship it.
 * @param useNnapi     register the NNAPI execution provider. Opt-in: NNAPI delegates
 *                     to vendor NPU/DSP drivers whose quality varies by device, and
 *                     unsupported operators fall back with a per-partition cost that
 *                     can end up slower than plain CPU.
